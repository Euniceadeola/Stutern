/*4.  What are the different ways you can clone an object? Give examples for each of them. */
// 1. Using Spread
//     Using spread will clone your object. Note this will be a shallow copy. As of this post, the spread operator for cloning objects is in Stage 4. So it's not officially in the specifications yet. So if you were to use this, you would need to compile it with Babel (or something similar).

    const food = { beef: 'ü•©', bacon: 'ü•ì' };

    const cloneFood = { ...food };

    console.log(cloneFood);
2. Using Object.assign
    Alternatively, Object.assign is in the official released and will also create a shallow copy of the object.

    const food = { beef: 'ü•©', bacon: 'ü•ì' };

    const cloneFood = Object.assign({}, food);

    console.log(cloneFood);

    Note the empty {} as the first argument, this will ensure you don't mutate the original object üëç

#3. Using JSON
    This final way will give you a deep copy. Now I will mention, this is a quick and dirty way of deep cloning an object. For a more robust solution, I would recommend using something like lodash

    const food = { beef: 'ü•©', bacon: 'ü•ì' };

    const cloneFood = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(food));

    console.log(cloneFood);
